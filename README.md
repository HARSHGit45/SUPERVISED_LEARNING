# Logistic Regression Model for Iris Dataset

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a Logistic Regression model trained on the famous Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and is often used for introductory tasks.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset is included in this repository as `iris.csv`. It consists of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and three classes of iris plants (setosa, versicolor, and virginica). The goal is to classify iris plants into the correct species based on these features.

## Project Structure

- `iris.csv`: The dataset file in CSV format.
- `logistic_regression_model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the Logistic Regression model training.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required for this project.

## Model Training

To train the Logistic Regression model on the Iris dataset, follow these steps:

1. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
